Even if it is Twitter Blue, you don't get your tick the same min, hour or day after your payment. Yes, you have access to other Twitter Blue features but the checkmark comes later after your profile has been verified (authenticated using your phone number). Sometimes, it takes hours, days and weeks. In fact, most times it takes days.

Even if it is legacy verified, you also would not know when your request will be approved.

Long and short, the blue tick is a coincidence and she has no control over when it would be on her profile. It has nothing to do with diverting attention."

323,@MattBinder I wonder if by requiring payment for verification if there is additional liability for Twitter to validate the accounts and more responsible for validating misinformation?
324,"Ready for an unpopular opinion? I am totally cool with Twitter embracing payment as a form of verification. And here is why, a big frustration I have had with the platform for years, has been how verification works. The classic blue checkmark, has been historically, simply, a popularity contest. 
As an actor, getting the checkmark by the old standards required a few things (keep in mind I am paraphrasing): 
1) You have a certain amount of professionally recognized acting credits (I do). 
2) You are a top performer on twitter in your region in terms of engagement, followers, and other non-communicated twitter metrics.
Think about that second criteria for a minute. And how intangible that is as a guiding principle for getting the blue checkmark. To get verified, you had to play a popularity guessing game to do it. Endless engagement, content creation, and efforts just to be recognized by the platform as 'worthy of following' in your field. 
And we know how popularity game strategies come to life on twitter: buying followers, mass following people and unfollowing after refollow in the hopes of boosting follower ratio, hiring social media managers to cater your account, etc...
As I am using the platform in connection to my professional endeavours, having to play an intangible popularity game was extremely frustrating and frankly a waste of my time. 
Don't get me wrong, the new system isn't perfect, but at least it is a simpler way to narrow down on the user being a real person, and has at least a small intent to treat the platform ""seriously"" (as demonstrated through their payment). 
My focus on twitter has always been sincere engagement and representation of my life and trade activities, I don't want to waste my time playing the twitter game, but I do want to signify that this is really me, I am a real person, and I am a professional. 
In my opinion, the new system brings us closer to this reality. And I think it has a lot of potential to be more fair for professional newcomers, while still honouring those that have been successful at playing the Twitter game already. ü§∑"

327,"After having twitter blue, I can tell you this...
Verification should be a one-time payment. It doesn't make sense as a subscription. Not to mention, some accounts SHOULDN'T be verified just because they pay the subscription. (fake accounts, accounts of dead people, ect) Keep the verification payment and the subscription for extra features separate. Make verification a real process that's taken seriously.
Also, the main audience who would WANT extras are people who need to market/advertise. So the extra features should cater more towards them. There's not much to gain here right now though. Maybe the subscription should give you the option to boost a tweet once a month or something? Focus-group it more."

371,"@elonmusk Elon, have you considered allowing third world country users to pay through their national payment rails to get verified?
